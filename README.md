# cancer-model
This notebook experiments with the breast cancer dataset included in scikit-learn and creates machine learning models such as K-Nearest-Neighbors to classify tumors as benign or malignant. It also tests the accuracy of the model using different values of neighbors. 

The notebook also analyzes the concept of overfitting and underfitting data, and the trends that different values of n have on the accuracy of predictions found on the training and testing set.

The code in the notebook will regulary be updated, as I continue to learn more about implementing machine learning algorithms.
